# INTRODUCTION TO MIDJOURNEY: LESSON
------------------------------------

* Getting Started
-----------------

Computers understanding what the world around us looks like has long been a dream of programmers and artists alike. As computers evolved and gained the ability to recognize various 
objects, the next logical step was for them to create these visuals themselves.

Finally, this dream has come true with Midjourney, a generative AI that allows users to generate unique images with only text. Think ChatGPT, but instead of an AI answering your prompts 
with text, it responds with an image instead! Keep reading through this lesson to learn more about this new technology and its large impact on industry, education, and even our daily 
lives!

* What is Midjourney?
---------------------
Midjourney is a groundbreaking generative image AI designed to craft visuals from only textual descriptions. This unique ability makes it possible for users to not just visualize simple 
objects like “a red apple” but also more intricate ideas such as “a futuristic cityscape at sunset” or even abstract thoughts like “the feeling of nostalgia.”

What sets Midjourney apart from other generative tools is its seamless integration with the popular chat platform, Discord. This comfortable, device-agnostic approach means that users can 
communicate and generate images on the fly from anywhere, making artistic creation even more accessible.

But Midjourney doesn’t stop at just generating images from text. It has a range of advanced features that can alter uploaded and generated pictures as well:

	. Adaptation: The platform can modify certain elements of an existing image based on a text prompt. If you have an image of a “blue car,” Midjourney can effortlessly transform it 
	into a “red car” without any manual editing.

	. Blend: Midjourney can take two distinct images and meld the concepts and aesthetics of each into a brand new visual.

	. Image Repair and Completion: If you have a partially hidden or damaged image, Midjourney can leverage the surrounding context and user-provided text prompts to repair or 
	complete it.
